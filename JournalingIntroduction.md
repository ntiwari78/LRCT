Journaling Introduction

Throughout this course, you will be asked to keep a leadership journal in which you can capture your thoughts, insights, and observations about leadership. I encourage you to obtain a hardbound notebook with at least 50 pages to use during the course. As we progress from module to module, I will assign specific topic for you to write about. I ask the learner to hand write comments in the book because I find that the physical act of writing information helps reinforce the learning and aid in recall from memory. Because you are writing this journal to yourself, please feel free to use your native language. Be sure to leave some space for comments when you return to your writings after further reflection.

As I pointed out in the video on journaling please do the following before you write.

1. Assess the text, video, or reading.

    What is the main point?
    Identify the purpose, impact, and/or theoretical framework of the text
    What ideas stood out to me? Why?

2. Develop your ideas

    What do I know about the topic?
    Where does my existing knowledge come from?
    Do I agree or disagree with the main ideas? Why?

3. Make Connections

    What are my existing ideas and assumptions?
    Does the new information challenge my existing ideas and assumptions? How?
    What relevant experiences have I had?
    What new insights to these connections lead me to?

4. Find your focus

    Donâ€™t try to cover every point
    Pick one or two key points that resonate with you.

With your thoughts in mind, sit down to write. Try to find a routine time of day where you can write for 10-15 minutes uninterrupted and with few distractions.

1. Hand write your comments

2. Revisit your comments periodically to update, revise, or elaborate.

3. I am specifically looking for your insights into the topics, and implications for actions you should take to develop your skills related to the topic.
